# Mtcars Explorer App

## Description
This repository contains the **Mtcars Explorer App**, a Shiny app designed to explore the classic `mtcars` dataset interactively. The app provides users with three main features:
1. **Slider and Checkboxes**: Users can filter cars based on horsepower (`hp`) and car brands.
2. **Interactive Table**: A dynamic, sortable table displays the filtered results, with default sorting by horsepower in descending order.
3. **Download Filtered Data**: Users can download the filtered dataset as a `.csv` file for offline analysis.

These features make the app user-friendly for exploring car specifications and narrowing down datasets to meet specific criteria.

## Dataset used
The dataset used in this app is the `mtcars` dataset, which is part of the base R datasets. This dataset contains data from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and it comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 cars.

Acknowledgment:
The `mtcars` dataset is available in R by default, and more information can be found [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).
